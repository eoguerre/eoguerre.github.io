I am a Professor of Economics at the School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London. My interests are in theoretical and applied econometrics. My research has been published in various journals, including the Annals of Statistics, Econometrica, Probability Theory and Related Fields, and the Review of Economic Studies.

I will be a recipient of the Journal of Econometrics Zellner award (best theory paper over 2002-23) for ["Quantile regression methods for first-price auctions"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407621001524) coauthored with [Nathalie Gimenes](https://sites.google.com/view/nathaliegimenes).
